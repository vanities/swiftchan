Why aren't there many open source apps? idk. Heavily inspired by TheChan. Plays webms and gifs natively in app.

Here's why:
* ios is ok, why did you switch from android?
* you don't want to download a shady app from 3rd party appstores and you're not jailbroken
* apple bans the app from the app store, but leaves reddit where you can search for people killing themselves :smile:


### Built With
Dev requirements used in the app with CocoaPods and Swift Package Manager.
