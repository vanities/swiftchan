Heavily inspired by TheChan. Plays webms and gifs natively in app.

Here's why:
* you don't want to download a shady app from 3rd party appstores and you're not jailbroken
* native webm support
* fast like swift


### Built With
Dev requirements used in the app with CocoaPods and Swift Package Manager.

* [FourChanApi](https://github.com/jackpal/FourChanAPI)
* [SwiftUIPager](https://github.com/fermoya/SwiftUIPager)
* [URLImage](https://github.com/dmytro-anokhin/url-image)
* [MobileVLCKit](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/VLCKit)
